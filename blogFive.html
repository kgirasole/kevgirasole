   <h2>Blog Post 5</h2>

	<p>Over the course of the class, I’ve learned a lot about what it takes to be a journalist and often how demanding it can be. I’ve gained a greater appreciation for what journalists and news reporters do for us because often it is a difficult job.</p>
    <br />
	<p>During Digital Journalism, we’ve learned about what journalists do and how they make their living. As per my professor, Katie Gibas, you have to churn out stories pretty fast. Often one (or more) a day. To me, this is a little insane, because working on just one story takes a while. A lot of planning goes into making a good story. Making a story per day seems very intense, given the quality of most news pieces. To be able to have that kind of turn over takes passion and know-how. </p>
    <br />
	<p>Being a journalist is also demanding, and you often find yourself covering stories that you don’t want to cover. Be it a tragic death in the community, or a house fire that left a family homeless, you have to cover it. We learned this from one of our guest speakers, Brian Hayden, who had been a journalist for some time. Oftentimes he’d leave his job upset or in a bad headspace because he covered a really depressing story. We also learned that often journalists and reporters must disconnect from their emotions and the piece at hand to avoid becoming upset, as we were told by Dom LaVallo, another guest speaker. Being able to work through these heavy emotions and upsetting stories in person is really tough and respectable. </p>
    <br />
	<p>Finally, through my own experience, interviewing is really tough. You often don’t know what to ask or what to bring up to get the response you are looking for. It is also really demanding to have to be social and personable with people you might not know well. As an introvert, having to put yourself out there and interview someone is tough, and it really takes some guts. Reporters and journalists have to do this every day and I really respect that they have the stones and the ability to carry out interview after interview.</p>
    <br />
	<p>In general, my respect and appreciation for journalists and reporters has skyrocketed. Their job is tough and it takes a lot of effort to do and do well. Their work should be appreciated more than it is because not many of us would do the job they do for the wages they make and the emotional distress they face.</p>
