	  While taking digital journalism, I’ve definitely learned a lot about how to produce stories, blogs, and other relevant pieces of media. I feel like I’ve come a long way in terms of the quality and overall feel of the pieces, but it has definitely taken some trial and error. After studying many different pieces of media in class, a few errors of mine definitely stick out.

Producing media has had its ups and downs for me. There are a few ways that I’ve noticed I can improve. Namely audio mixing and the quantity and quality of my video shots. First off, audio mixing really caught me off guard. I thought it would be relatively easy and straightforward but that was far from the case. The issue stems from the fact that each clip has a different starting volume, depending on where the mic is located, how loud a person is talking, etc. When tweaking the audio levels in iMovie or Premiere, the volume always starts at 100%, regardless of how loud it actually is. This led to the audio mixing on my projects being less than stellar, especially on the first. A trademark of a good story is consistent audio throughout. My stories lacked that, especially my first. I will definitely be perfecting this for our final project. Finally, I feel as though my video shots for my second story could use some improvement. I got a bit tunnel visioned on the close up shots and really neglected my wider shots. You need a variety of shots to pull a story together. I really only had one medium shot, and that did my story a disservice. One last comment on my video is that I feel as though some of the quality of the video differed. Some were very well done and the fidelity was great, and some were not. I need to make a bigger emphasis in the future of getting more shots, and more shots that are of high quality, just to make sure it is consistent throughout.

I’ve learned a lot about how to produce quality media, and I will be trying to nail it for our final project. As I mentioned above, I’ve identified two major problems that I am to tackle, and I’m excited to see how it turns out.
