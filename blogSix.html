      	Since the invention and widespread adoption of the internet, users have been flocking in droves to use internet enabled electronic devices. Due to this technological development, we have entered the Age of Information, and as such, our world has developed alongside it. One area of modern society that has had to adapt to this new medium is the field of journalism. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As per our digital journalism professor, Katie Gibas, news shooting has moved from a traditional camera set to reporters simply using their phones. Often camera quality is better and it is much more compact. I reckon we will see more technological advancements such as this. Cell phones may get better microphones which eliminate the need for a shotgun or lavalier mic. We may move to new devices in the near future that eliminate the need for a cell phone. Regardless, the tools of the trade will continue to evolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a>, usage of the internet has exploded in recent years, citing an approximate 25% increase in usage in the U.S. from 2000 to 2016. Media has had to respond to this craze by beginning to market and post news on the internet. Many people have migrated from classic cable television to streaming services and online video platforms such as YouTube. To keep up, news stations have had to make web articles, video clips and multimedia stories to post online to cater to this huge increase. I suspect that multimedia stories will continue to evolve and become the norm online. News outlets such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> have already begun adopting the multimedia model, which helps digest data, and increase interaction with the user. Within time, many news stories will be interactive and have numerous calls-to-action to entice user interaction and engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout time, media will continue to change, probably more than we realize. However, even now, the media is changing and we may not even notice. The increase in available data, statistics and outreach potential is driving the way forward for media and news outlets and they will no doubt continue to capitalize on it in the future.
